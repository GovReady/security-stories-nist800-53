  - title: As the CIO, I want to document and communicate our organization's approach and priorities for having an reliable audit trail of transactions in our IT systems.

    body: |

      *Why:*
      Logging various transactions in our IT systems is how we can later audit activity for things that went wrong and for malicious actions. Without audit trail we won't have a record of interactions with the system.

      *How:* 
      * Define roles in addition to ISSO or ISSM that the audit and accountability policy is to be disseminated to. (State if there are no additional roles)
      * Define roles in addition to ISSO or ISSM that the audit and accountability procedures are to be disseminated to. (State if there are no additional roles)
      * Ensure that the audit accountability policy and procedures are disseminated
      * Define frequency at which to review and update the audit and accountability policy and procedures (Annually).
      * Maintain audit trail of reviews and updates.


      *Acceptance Criteria / Evidence:*
      * List of personnel to whom accountability policy and procedures are to be disseminated
      * Audit and accountability policy
      * Audit and accountability policy version update page
      * Audit and accountability policy audit trail of reviews and updates

  - title: As the CIO, I need my team alerted whenever the information system's logging subsystem fails so steps can be taken to avoid further loss of audit data.
    body: |

      *Why*
      We don’t want to lose critical audit records because of errors in the auditing system.


      *How*
      * Set up monitoring to detect issues with the audit system. Examples
        * Pingdom
        * Amazon CloudWatch
        * New Relic
      * A custom script monitoring updated timestamps
      * Decide who should receive alerts.
      * Determine an effective test frequency and alert method (text, email, Slack).
      * Check the audit system monitors every two months to ensure they are working properly.


      *Acceptance Criteria / Evidence*
      * List of the people and method to alert when there are issues with the audit system.

  - title: As the CISO, I want transactions in logs to clearly use a UTC timestamps so data can be synchronized with less processing.

    body: |
      *Why*
      Reports need to be timestamped with an universally understood format to assist in analysis of events and system/data recovery.
      When different logs use different timezones and/or non-standard formats, it is harder to collate and compare events across different logs.


      *How*
      * Create organization standard for transaction record timestamp granularity of least 1 second
      * Create record timestamping mechanism that timestamps transactions with defined granularity in UTC or GMT
      * Timestamp with a system’s clock


      *Acceptance Criteria / Evidence*
      * Excerpt from STIG or SRG in use that defines timestamp granularity standard
      * Show example of logged events are being timestamped or configuration that forces timestamps

  - title: As the CISO, I want to retain log files long enough to investigate security incidents that happened weeks or months ago.

    body: |

      *Why*
      We may not learn of a penetration or security incident when it happens. Also, there may be regulatory requirements for retaining audit records.


      *How*
      Determine the official retention periods for different types of audit records (e.g., check organization policy and pertinent regulations)
      Make sure system is configured to either not delete log files too soon, or logs are transferred to a service or separate storage for retention


      *Acceptance Criteria / Evidence*
      * Excerpt of audit and accountability policy specifying retention periods of audit logs
      * Copy of an after action report which includes audit log information
      * Excerpt from STIG or SRG in use that automatically sets or specifies audit retention periods

  - title: As a CISO, I need to periodically check for data spillage and indicators of breaches showing up online.

    body: |

      *Details*
      Some types of content we are trying to protect:
      * User accounts
      * PII
      * Server configuration (error messages)
      * Secrets (in code repos)
      * Brainstorm ways to look for our information on the public web.
      * Develop a list of search terms that would indicate unauthorized information might be appearing online.
      * Identify a list of organizationally controlled information services that might accidentally leak organizational information (e.g., newsletters, website, powerpoint presentations).
      * Set up a google newsalert for FCC Hack,
      * Find a service that searches publicly available information for data spills; look for government services providers
