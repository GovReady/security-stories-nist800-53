  - title: As the CISO, I need to ensure that that an effective security awareness and training program is in place.

    body: |

      *Why:*
      Our security protocol is only as strong as the weakest link, and oftentimes the most effective security strategy begins with ensuring that all staff are aware of the importance of taking IT security seriously.


      *How:* 
      * Create a security awareness and training policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance.
      * Define the frequency with which the security training policy will be reviewed and updated.
      * Provide basic security awareness training to all IT system users:
        * As part of the initial training for new users
        * After IT system changes
        * In regular frequencies
      * Trainings can include:
        * Displaying posters
        * Offering supplies inscribed with security reminders
        * Sending emails from senior officials
        * Displaying logon screen messages
        * Holding training and security awareness events
      * Conduct role-based training for users with additional privilages before authorizing additional access and in regular frequencies.


      *Acceptance Criteria / Evidence:*
      * Security awareness and training policy
      * Secuity training event curriculum
      * Additional security-related posters, supplies, and messages
