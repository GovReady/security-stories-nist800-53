  - title: As the CISO, I want to retain log files long enough to investigate security incidents that happened weeks or months ago.

    body: |

      *Why*
      We may not learn of a penetration or security incident when it happens. Also, there may be regulatory requirements for retaining audit records.


      *How*
      Determine the official retention periods for different types of audit records (e.g., check organization policy and pertinent regulations)
      Make sure system is configured to either not delete log files too soon, or logs are transferred to a service or separate storage for retention


      *Acceptance Criteria / Evidence*
      * Excerpt of audit and accountability policy specifying retention periods of audit logs
      * Copy of an after action report which includes audit log information
      * Excerpt from STIG or SRG in use that automatically sets or specifies audit retention periods
